# random_proverb

my first public repo, just started writing python and have been enjoying Pyqt5 so thought i would post this! :D

## Description

This is a python GUI application using pyQt5 that will output a random proverb from the book of proverbs, also has a "next" and a "previous" button if you want to keep reading ! 

## Installation

you will need to install this pyqt5 for it to work as intended

(pip install pyqt5)

if anyone wants to make a .exe that would be nice !
(i dont want to touch windows with a 10 foot pole)
